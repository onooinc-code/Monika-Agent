Feature: Conversation Search
ID: 16

Description:
Implement a search functionality in the conversation list sidebar that allows users to quickly find conversations based on their title or the content of their messages.

Core Functionalities:
1.  **Search Input UI:**
    -   Add a search input field at the top of the `ConversationList` component.
    -   The input should be styled consistently with the application's aesthetic.

2.  **Client-Side Filtering Logic:**
    -   As the user types into the search field, the list of conversations should be filtered in real-time.
    -   The filtering logic should be case-insensitive.
    -   The search should match the query against both the `title` of the conversation and the `text` of every message within each conversation.

3.  **No Results State:**
    -   If the search query yields no results, the UI should display a helpful message (e.g., "No matching conversations found.").
