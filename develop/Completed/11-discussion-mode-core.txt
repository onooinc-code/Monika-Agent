Feature: Moderated Chat Mode
ID: 11

Description:
Implement a "Moderated Chat" mode where a dynamic, multi-turn conversation can occur between multiple AI agents, moderated by the AI Agent Manager. This allows for more complex problem-solving where agents can build on, critique, or collaborate on each other's ideas.

Core Functionalities:
1.  **Mode Activation:**
    -   Add a toggle or setting within the "Per-Conversation Settings" modal to enable "Moderated Chat".
    -   When enabled, the normal `Dynamic` and `Continuous` modes are superseded by this new logic.

2.  **Moderation Loop:**
    -   After a user sends a message, the AI Agent Manager is invoked first.
    -   The Manager analyzes the conversation state and decides which agent should speak next to advance the discussion.
    -   The chosen agent generates a response.
    -   The loop repeats: The Manager analyzes the new state (including the latest agent's response) and decides the next action (another agent speaks, or the conversation pauses for user input).

3.  **Manager's Role:**
    -   The Manager's primary role is to guide the conversation according to a set of rules or a goal.
    -   It can critique an agent's response if it's off-topic or unhelpful.
    -   It decides when the conversation has reached a logical conclusion or requires further input from the user, at which point it will pause the loop.

4.  **UI/UX:**
    -   Clearly indicate in the UI when "Moderated Chat" mode is active.
    -   Messages from the Manager (like critiques or decisions) should be visually distinct from regular agent messages.
    -   The `LiveStatusIndicator` should reflect the current state (e.g., "Manager is moderating...", "Agent X is responding...").
