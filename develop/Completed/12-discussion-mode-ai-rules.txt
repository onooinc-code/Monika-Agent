Feature: AI-Generated Discussion Rules
ID: 12

Description:
Enhance the "Moderated Chat" mode by allowing the AI Agent Manager to dynamically generate the rules and turn-taking order for the discussion based on the agents' profiles and the current conversation topic.

Core Functionalities:
1.  **Rule Generation Trigger:**
    -   In the "Per-Conversation Settings" modal, next to the "Moderated Chat" toggle, add a "Generate Rules with AI" button.

2.  **AI Service for Rule Generation:**
    -   Create a new service function that takes the list of active agents and the recent conversation history as input.
    -   This service will prompt the Gemini API to analyze the agents' roles (e.g., "Creative Writer," "Technical Analyst") and the topic.
    -   The AI should return a concise system prompt that defines the rules for the discussion (e.g., "The Technical Analyst will provide the data, then the Creative Writer will craft a narrative around it.").

3.  **Applying the Rules:**
    -   The generated rules will be populated into a textarea in the settings modal.
    -   The user can review, edit, or accept these rules.
    -   When the moderated chat runs, these rules are passed to the AI Agent Manager as part of its system prompt to guide its moderation decisions.
