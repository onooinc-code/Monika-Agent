Feature: Message Interaction Toolbar
ID: 07

Description:
Provide a rich, hover-activated toolbar on each message bubble to give users quick access to common actions and view/display settings without cluttering the interface.

Core Functionalities:
1.  **Hover-to-Reveal:**
    -   The toolbar is hidden by default and smoothly appears when the user hovers their mouse over the message bubble.

2.  **Common Actions:**
    -   Provide one-click buttons for essential message interactions:
        -   **Copy:** Copies the message's text content to the clipboard.
        -   **Bookmark:** Toggles the bookmarked state of the message.
        -   **Delete:** Deletes the message from the conversation (with a confirmation).

3.  **Contextual Actions:**
    -   Show actions relevant to the message type:
        -   For **User Messages:** An "Edit" button to modify the prompt.
        -   For **AI Messages:** A "Regenerate" button to get an alternative response.

4.  **Display & Formatting Controls:**
    -   Include controls for adjusting the visual presentation of the message bubble:
        -   **Alignment:** Buttons to align the bubble to the left or right.
        -   **Font Size:** Buttons to increase or decrease the text size within the bubble.
        -   **Text Direction:** Buttons to toggle between Left-to-Right (LTR) and Right-to-Left (RTL) text rendering.

5.  **Metadata Display:**
    -   Subtly display useful metadata within the toolbar:
        -   **Token Count:** Show the estimated number of tokens for the message.
        -   **Response Time:** For AI messages, show the time it took to generate the response in milliseconds.
