Feature: Backend Process Transparency
ID: 09

Description:
Provide users with a clear, real-time view into the AI's "thought process" as it decides on actions and generates responses. This is crucial for building trust and for debugging complex multi-agent interactions.

Core Functionalities:
1.  **Live Status Indicator:**
    -   Display a persistent, non-intrusive status bar or indicator at the bottom of the chat interface.
    -   This indicator should show the current state of the backend, such as: "Manager is deciding who should speak...", "Creative Writer is generating a response...", "Analyzing user input...".
    -   This provides immediate feedback to the user that their request is being processed, reducing perceived latency.

2.  **Cognitive Workflow Visualizer:**
    -   Create a modal or a dedicated view that displays the step-by-step pipeline the AI took to generate a specific response.
    -   For each step in the pipeline (e.g., "Context Assembly", "Model Invocation", "Tool Call"), visualize the input and output data.
    -   This allows developers and power users to "look under the hood" and understand exactly how a decision was made or a response was formulated.

3.  **Prompt & Response Inspector:**
    -   For any AI-generated message, provide an option to inspect the exact, raw prompt that was sent to the Gemini API and the raw response that was received.
    -   This is an invaluable debugging tool for prompt engineering and for understanding why an AI might be behaving in an unexpected way.
    -   The inspector should format the JSON prompt and response for readability and provide copy-to-clipboard functionality.
