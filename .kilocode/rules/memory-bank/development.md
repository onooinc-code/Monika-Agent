# Development Cycle

## Overview

Monica follows a structured, feature-driven development process that ensures clarity, quality, and traceability throughout the entire lifecycle. This systematic approach is designed to be followed by both human and AI developers, providing clear guidelines and artifacts at each stage.

## The Six-Phase Development Process

Each new feature or significant change goes through a structured, six-phase lifecycle that ensures quality and maintainability.

### Phase 1: Idea & Feature Definition

**Purpose**: Establish a clear, formal specification that serves as the single source of truth for the entire development team.

**Process**:
- A new feature begins as a formal specification document
- The document clearly outlines the feature's objectives and core functionalities
- Serves as the foundation for all subsequent development phases

**Artifacts**:
- **File Format**: Plain text file (`.txt`)
- **Naming Convention**: `{number}-{feature-name}.txt` (e.g., `15-streaming-responses.txt`)
- **Initial Location**: `Monica-Documentation/features/Remaining/`
- **Content Structure**:
  - Feature number and title
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed solution
  - User stories/requirements
  - Success criteria
  - Dependencies and constraints

**Example Feature Definition**:
```
15-streaming-responses.txt

Feature: Real-time Streaming Responses
Problem: Users experience long wait times for AI responses, creating poor UX
Solution: Implement streaming responses that show AI thinking in real-time
Requirements:
- Show partial responses as they are generated
- Maintain conversation context during streaming
- Handle streaming errors gracefully
- Support cancellation of streaming requests
Success Criteria:
- Response time appears < 1 second to user
- No loss of conversation context
- Proper error handling for network issues
```

### Phase 2: Planning

**Purpose**: Create a detailed implementation plan before writing any code to prevent costly rework and ensure clean integration.

**Process**:
- Analyze the feature requirements in detail
- Make architectural decisions
- Identify all files that will be created or modified
- Define new functions, components, and data structures
- Outline the state management strategy
- Plan the user interface and user experience

**Key Activities**:
- **File Impact Analysis**: Determine which existing files need modification
- **New File Planning**: Define new components, services, and utilities needed
- **State Management Design**: Plan how the feature integrates with existing state
- **API Design**: Define any new API calls or data structures
- **UI/UX Planning**: Design the user interface and interaction patterns
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Plan for edge cases and error scenarios

**Planning Deliverables**:
- Updated feature definition file with technical details
- List of files to be created/modified
- Component hierarchy and relationships
- State management approach
- API integration points

### Phase 3: Implementation

**Purpose**: Execute the plan by writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code that fulfills the feature requirements.

**Process**:
- Follow the established implementation plan
- Write code according to project coding standards
- Implement proper error handling and edge cases
- Add appropriate logging and debugging information
- Ensure TypeScript type safety
- Follow component architecture patterns

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function and component should have one clear purpose
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces and proper typing
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of the implementation
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible and keyboard navigable
- **Testing**: Write code that is testable and includes appropriate test hooks

**Code Quality Standards**:
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use consistent code formatting
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use existing design patterns and architectural principles

### Phase 4: Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure the feature works correctly and doesn't break existing functionality through comprehensive testing.

**Process**:
- Generate a comprehensive QA test plan
- Cover all aspects of the new feature
- Include static code analysis and risk assessment
- Write unit and integration test scenarios
- Create step-by-step manual end-to-end test plans

**Artifacts**:
- **File Format**: Markdown file (`.md`)
- **Naming Convention**: `{number}-{feature-name}.md` (e.g., `15-streaming-responses.md`)
- **Location**: `Monica-Documentation/testing/`
- **Content Structure**:
  - Test objectives and scope
  - Static analysis checklist
  - Risk assessment
  - Unit test scenarios (Gherkin syntax)
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Manual E2E test plan
  - Edge cases and error scenarios

**Testing Categories**:
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality, TypeScript errors, linting issues
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full user workflow testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Testing**: Load times and resource usage
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Compatibility across different browsers

**Example Test Scenario**:
```gherkin
Feature: Real-time streaming responses
  As a user
  I want to see AI responses as they are generated
  So that I don't have to wait for complete responses

  Scenario: Successful streaming response
    Given I am in a conversation
    When I send a message
    Then I should see partial responses appearing in real-time
    And the response should complete within reasonable time
    And the conversation context should be maintained
```

### Phase 5: Completion & Documentation

**Purpose**: Finalize the feature implementation and update all relevant documentation.

**Process**:
- Move the feature definition file from `Remaining/` to `Completed/`
- Update architectural documentation if needed
- Update user-facing documentation
- Add any new components to the component library documentation
- Update API documentation if new endpoints were added
- Create or update usage examples

**File Movement**:
- **From**: `Monica-Documentation/features/Remaining/{number}-{feature-name}.txt`
- **To**: `Monica-Documentation/features/Completed/{number}-{feature-name}.txt`
- **Purpose**: Creates a clear audit trail of completed work

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update component library documentation for new components
- Add usage examples and best practices
- Update architectural diagrams if the feature changed system structure
- Add API documentation for new endpoints
- Update user guides and help documentation

### Phase 6: Production

**Purpose**: Deploy the feature to production and make it available to users.

**Process**:
- Merge the feature branch into the main branch
- Deploy to production environment
- Monitor for any issues post-deployment
- Gather user feedback and usage metrics
- Address any immediate production issues

**Deployment Checklist**:
- All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- Feature flags properly configured
- Database migrations applied (if any)
- Documentation updated and published
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Rollback plan in place

**Post-Deployment**:
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- Gather user feedback through analytics
- Address any immediate issues or bugs
- Plan for future enhancements based on usage patterns

## Development Workflow Integration

### For Human Developers
1. **Feature Inception**: Create feature definition file in `Remaining/` directory
2. **Planning Session**: Review and refine the implementation approach
3. **Implementation**: Write code following established patterns
4. **Code Review**: Submit for peer review with clear description of changes
5. **Testing**: Execute test plan and address any issues
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
7. **Deployment**: Merge and deploy to production

### For AI Developers
1. **Feature Analysis**: Read feature definition file to understand requirements
2. **Planning**: Analyze existing codebase to understand integration points
3. **Implementation**: Write code following the same patterns as human developers
4. **Testing**: Generate and execute test scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect new functionality
6. **Validation**: Ensure all changes follow established conventions
