# Feature: Conversation Titling and Identification

## 1. Objective
To allow users to easily identify conversations through clear, editable titles, with an AI-assisted option for convenience.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Manual Renaming
- The title of the currently active conversation shall be displayed in the main header area.
- The title should be an editable field (e.g., click-to-edit).
- After editing, the new title must be saved to the database and updated in the conversation list side panel.

### 2.2. AI-Powered Renaming
- An icon or button (e.g., "sparkle" icon) shall be placed next to the conversation title.
- When clicked, this action triggers a call to a dedicated AI model.
- The model will receive the current message history as context.
- The AI's task is to generate a concise and relevant title (e.g., "Brainstorming Sci-Fi Story Ideas") for the conversation.
- The generated title automatically replaces the current title, but the user can still edit it manually afterward.
