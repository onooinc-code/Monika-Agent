## 2. Core Functionality

- These actions will be part of the same hover-toolbar as the standard actions.

### 2.2. AI-Powered Actions

- **Summarize (AI Messages):**
  - Appears on AI-generated messages.
  - When clicked, it generates a concise summary of that specific message's content on-demand. The summary could appear in a pop-up or replace the message content with an option to revert.

- **Regenerate (AI Messages):**
  - Appears on AI-generated messages.
  - When clicked, it sends the *preceding user prompt* to the AI again to generate a new, alternative response.
  - The UI should handle the display of multiple responses for a single prompt (e.g., a "1 of 2" navigator).

- **Rewrite (User Messages):**
  - Appears on user-sent messages.
  - When clicked, the AI is asked to rewrite the user's prompt for better clarity, detail, or effectiveness.
  - The user is presented with the rewritten prompt and can choose to accept it.
  - If accepted, the rewritten prompt is used to get a new response from the AI.
