# Feature: Discussion Mode (AI-Generated Rules)

## 1. Objective
To automate the setup of Discussion Mode by having an AI generate the initial set of conversation rules and the agent reply order.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Automatic Generation
- When a user enables Discussion Mode for a conversation, an AI process is triggered.
- This process analyzes the profiles of the agents currently active in the conversation.
- The analysis considers:
  - Agent System Instructions
  - Agent Specializes (e.g., 'technical writer', 'critic')
  - (Optional) The current conversation topic, if one can be inferred.

### 2.2. Generated Output
- Based on the analysis, the AI will generate and propose:
  - **A set of Conversation Rules:** e.g., "Rule 1: The Creative Writer proposes an idea. Rule 2: The Technical Analyst evaluates its feasibility."
  - **A Reply Order:** e.g., "User -> Agent 1 -> Agent 2 -> Agent 1 -> User..."

### 2.3. User-Editable
- The generated rules and order are presented to the user in an editable format within the conversation settings modal.
- The user can accept the suggestions as-is or modify them to better suit their goal for the discussion.
