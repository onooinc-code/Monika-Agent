# Feature: Automatic Agent Generation

## 1. Objective
To simplify the creation of new, specialized AI agents by using an AI to generate their profiles based on high-level user input.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Generation Interface
- A new "Generate Agent" feature will be added to the settings screen.
- The user will be presented with a simple form to provide the basis for generation.

### 2.2. Input Parameters
The user can provide one or more of the following to guide the generation process:
- **A Topic:** e.g., "Quantum Physics"
- **A Context:** e.g., "We are writing a screenplay for a historical drama."
- **A Goal:** e.g., "To create a meal plan for a family of four."

### 2.3. Generation Process
- The user's input is sent to a powerful AI model.
- The model's task is to generate a complete agent profile, populating all the fields from the "Advanced Agent Configuration" feature:
  - Specializes
  - Name
  - Personality
  - Instructions
  - Knowledge
- For example, a "Goal" of "Review my code for bugs" might generate an agent named "Code Sentinel" with a specialization in "Software Quality Assurance" and instructions on common programming pitfalls.

### 2.4. Review and Save
- The generated agent profile is presented to the user for review.
- The user can edit any of the generated fields before saving the new agent to their list.
