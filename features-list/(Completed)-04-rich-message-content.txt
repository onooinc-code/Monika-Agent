# Feature: Rich Message Content

## 1. Objective
To enhance the expressiveness and utility of messages by supporting rich formatting, code, and multi-modal inputs.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Rich Text Formatting
- All messages (both user and AI) must support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
- This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Headings
  - Bold, italics, strikethrough
  - Blockquotes
  - Ordered and unordered lists
  - Tables
  - Links
  - Code blocks (inline and fenced)

### 2.2. Code Block Syntax Highlighting
- Fenced code blocks should automatically detect the language (e.g., ```javascript) and apply appropriate syntax highlighting for readability.

### 2.3. Multi-Modal Input
- The message input component will continue to support image attachments.
- The attached image should be displayed within the message bubble and sent as context to the AI model.

### 2.4. Secure HTML Rendering
- For AI-generated code blocks specifically marked as `html`, a "View HTML" button or action shall be available.
- Clicking this button will render the HTML content within a secure, sandboxed `<iframe>` to prevent security risks (e.g., XSS). This allows for safe previewing of generated web content.
