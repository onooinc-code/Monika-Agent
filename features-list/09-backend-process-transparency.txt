# Feature: Backend Process Transparency

## 1. Objective
To provide advanced users and developers with insight into the AI's "thought process" by exposing the steps of the backend cognitive pipeline.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Cognitive Inspector
- An "Inspect" action will be available on the message hover-toolbar for AI-generated messages.
- Clicking this action opens a modal or detailed view.
- This view will display a breakdown of the backend pipeline that was executed to generate the response (e.g., "Context Assembly" or "Memory Extraction").
- It should visualize the steps in the pipeline, showing the inputs and outputs for each stage (e.g., "1. Retrieved memories", "2. Assembled context from recent messages", "3. Final prompt to model").

### 2.2. Live Progress Indicators
- While a backend pipeline is running (e.g., after the user sends a message), the UI should display subtle progress indicators.
- This provides feedback that the system is working and can hint at the current stage (e.g., a small label that says "Assembling Context...").
- This enhances the user experience by making the wait time feel more interactive and transparent.
