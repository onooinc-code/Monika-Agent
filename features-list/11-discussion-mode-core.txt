# Feature: Discussion Mode (Core)

## 1. Objective
To create an interactive mode where multiple AI agents can engage in a conversation with each other and the user, orchestrated by a manager agent.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Mode Activation
- "Discussion Mode" will be a new option selectable by the user for a conversation, likely within the per-conversation settings.

### 2.2. Shared Context
- In this mode, all agents in the conversation have access to the full conversation history. When one agent "speaks", the other agents are aware of that message.

### 2.3. The Manager Agent's Role
- The Agent Manager's role is expanded in this mode. It is responsible for defining:
  - **The Reply Order:** The sequence in which agents should respond. This can be a strict turn-by-turn order or a more dynamic decision based on the ongoing dialogue.
  - **The Conversation Rules:** A set of instructions that govern the discussion (e.g., "Agents must build upon each other's ideas," "Agent-2 should critique the solution proposed by Agent-1").

### 2.4. User Control
- The user can still interject in the conversation at any point.
- The user has the ability to view and edit the Manager Agent's rules and reply order.
