**Monica** is an advanced, client-side AI assistant designed for complex, multi-agent conversations. It provides a flexible platform where users can configure and interact with a team of specialized AI agents within a single, coherent chat interface. The primary goal is to create a transparent, powerful, and user-friendly environment for exploring sophisticated AI interactions that go beyond simple question-and-answer formats.

The application's "Future World" aesthetic is built on glassmorphism, dark mode, and vibrant neon highlights, creating a modern and immersive user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Monica is a pure client-side application that runs directly in the browser from static files. There is no build step or server-side dependency.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
*   A Gemini API key.
*   An environment capable of serving static files (e.g., the VS Code "Live Server" extension or any simple web server).

### Running the Application

1.  **API Key Configuration:** The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key **must** be available in the execution environment as `process.env.API_KEY`.
    > **Important:** This is a hard requirement. The application is designed for development environments where this variable can be injected. Users can also provide a key at runtime in the main settings, which is then stored in `localStorage`.

2.  **Serve the Files:** Serve the project's root directory using a static file server.

3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your browser via the server's address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`).

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive

Monica follows a clean, feature-oriented, three-layer architecture to ensure logic is decoupled and maintainable.

### Project File Structure

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/           # React context for state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/          # Custom hooks for logic domains
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StateProvider.tsx # Main context provider
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # External API interactions (Gemini API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                 # Other root files
```

### Data Flow & Logic Separation

1.  **UI Layer (`/components`):** The presentation layer. Responsible for what the user sees and captures their input. Components are stateless where possible, receiving data and callbacks from the State Layer.

2.  **State & Orchestration Layer (`/contexts`):** The control layer and "brain" of the application. It manages all application data and business logic via React Context and a series of specialized custom hooks.

3.  **Service Layer (`/services`):** The data layer. It handles all communication with the Google Gemini API. It is composed of stateless, asynchronous functions that construct prompts, call the API, and handle errors.

## üß† State Management (`AppContext`)

All global state is managed within `StateProvider.tsx`, which acts as a central orchestrator. It composes a series of domain-specific custom hooks to manage different facets of the application's logic.

-   **`useConversationManager`**: Handles all CRUD operations for conversations and messages.
-   **`useChatHandler`**: Contains the core logic for sending messages and orchestrating the AI response flow.
-   **`useModalManager`**: Centralizes the open/closed state for all modals, panels, and context menus.
-   **`useMemoryManager`**: Manages the state of the AI's long-term memory object.
-   **`useUsageTracker`**: Handles client-side estimation and persistence of API usage metrics.
-   **`useHistoryHandler`**: Manages the logic for generating the structured conversation history view.
-   **`useSoundManager`**: Provides a centralized way to play UI sound effects.
-   **`useUIPrefsManager`**: Manages persistent user UI preferences.

## üìù Development Rules & Standards

### Development Process
The project follows a structured, six-phase lifecycle which is now considered complete for this client-side version. All features have been implemented, tested, and documented.

### Coding Standards
-   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Every file, component, and function must have a single, well-defined purpose.
-   **Type Safety:** The project is 100% TypeScript. Avoid using `any`.
-   **Functional Components & Hooks:** All components are functional.
-   **Stateless Services:** All functions in the `/services` directory are stateless.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** All API calls are wrapped in a `try...catch` block and use custom error classes for consistent error management.

## üî≠ Future Vision

The project documentation outlines an ambitious vision for evolving Monica from an advanced AI assistant into a professional-grade, collaborative AI Development & Operations Platform by leveraging a sophisticated backend architecture.

Key areas for future growth include:
-   **Core Platform & Collaboration:** User Accounts, Multi-Device Sync, Team Workspaces, and Real-time Collaboration.
-   **Advanced Agent Intelligence:** Shared Team Memory, dynamic knowledge base integration (Notion, Google Drive), and agent self-improvement loops.
-   **Workflow Automation:** A visual, drag-and-drop workflow builder to automate complex, multi-step tasks.
-   **Analytics & Monetization:** Dashboards for cost analysis, a marketplace for community-built agents, and subscription tiers.
