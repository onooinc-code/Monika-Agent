## üöÄ Getting Started

Monica is a client-side application built with Next.js 14.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm).
*   A Google Gemini API key.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd MonicaAgentv4
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **API Key Configuration:** The application requires a Google Gemini API key. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the `MonicaAgentv4` directory and add your key:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    > **Note:** Users can also provide a key at runtime in the main settings, which is then stored in `localStorage` and will override the environment variable.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open in Browser:** Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive

Monica follows a clean, feature-oriented, three-layer architecture to ensure logic is decoupled and maintainable.

### Project File Structure

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                  # Next.js App Router (layout, page, globals)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/           # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/             # React context for state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Custom hooks for logic domains
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StateProvider.tsx   # Main context provider
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/             # External API interactions (Gemini API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                   # Config files (next.config.js, etc.)
```

### Data Flow & Logic Separation

1.  **UI Layer (`/components`):** The presentation layer. Responsible for what the user sees and capturing their input. Components are stateless where possible, receiving data and callbacks from the State Layer.

2.  **State & Orchestration Layer (`/contexts`):** The control layer and "brain" of the application. It manages all application data and business logic via React Context and a series of specialized custom hooks.

3.  **Service Layer (`/services`):** The data layer. It handles all communication with the Google Gemini API. It is composed of stateless, asynchronous functions that construct prompts, call the API, and handle errors.

## üî≠ Future Vision

The project documentation outlines an ambitious vision for evolving Monica from an advanced AI assistant into a professional-grade, collaborative AI Development & Operations Platform by leveraging a sophisticated backend architecture.

Key areas for future growth include:
-   **Core Platform & Collaboration:** User Accounts, Multi-Device Sync, Team Workspaces, and Real-time Collaboration.
-   **Advanced Agent Intelligence:** Shared Team Memory, dynamic knowledge base integration (Notion, Google Drive), and agent self-improvement loops.
-   **Workflow Automation:** A visual, drag-and-drop workflow builder to automate complex, multi-step tasks.
-   **Analytics & Monetization:** Dashboards for cost analysis, a marketplace for community-built agents, and subscription tiers.
